# html
Looks good in general,
bem for next level

# css
Organize by COMPONENTS
comments are actually good in CSS
  ex: in comments
  logo styles
  CSS
  end logo styles

  form stylesheet
  CSS
  end form styles

  Be consistent with spacing

  one button class:
  .button {

  }
  and then a button-read class as well, for greater specificity

  get stuff you are not using (REDUNDANCIES & repeated stuff) out of there!!!

   for FLOATS don't forget about clear fix!


# JS

Get rid of redundant variables

use TEMPLATE LITERALS to interpolate for dynamic pieces
  ie buildCard
  see bookmarksSection.appendChild(`
    <div>${websiteURL}</div>

#github
  Commits
    capitalize first letter
    type as much as you can in 30 sections
